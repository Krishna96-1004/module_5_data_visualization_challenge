# module_5_data_visualization_challenge

The code provided performs several steps to analyze a dataset related to a study on mice. Here’s a summary of what the code does:

1.	Import Dependencies: The necessary Python libraries are imported, which include matplotlib for data visualization, pandas for data manipulation, and scipy for scientific computing.

2.	Load Data: The data files Mouse_metadata.csv and Study_results.csv are loaded into pandas DataFrames.

3.	Merge Data: The mouse metadata and study results are merged into a single DataFrame using the ‘Mouse ID’ column as the key.

4.	Data Cleaning: The merged DataFrame is checked for duplicate entries based on ‘Mouse ID’ and ‘Timepoint’. Any duplicates found are removed to create a clean DataFrame.

5.	Summary Statistics: The clean DataFrame is grouped by ‘Drug Regimen’, and summary statistics are calculated for the ‘Tumor Volume (mm3)’ column. These statistics include the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM (Standard Error of Mean). The results are displayed in a summary DataFrame.

6.	Data Visualization: Bar plots are generated to show the total number of rows (Mouse ID/Timepoints) for each drug regimen. This is done using both pandas and pyplot methods. Additionally, pie plots are created to show the distribution of female versus male mice in the study, again using both pandas and pyplot methods.

7.	Final Tumor Volume Calculation: The code starts by selecting data for four treatment regimens: Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin. It then finds the last timepoint for each mouse and merges this data with the original DataFrame to get the tumor volume at the last timepoint.

8.	Outlier Detection: For each treatment, it calculates the Interquartile Range (IQR) of the tumor volumes and uses this to identify any potential outliers (values that fall below Q1-1.5IQR or above Q3+1.5IQR).

9.	Data Visualization: It generates a box plot showing the distribution of final tumor volumes for each treatment regimen.

10.	Line and Scatter Plots: The code generates a line plot of tumor volume vs. time point for a single mouse treated with Capomulin and a scatter plot of mouse weight vs. average tumor volume for all mice in the Capomulin regimen.

11.	Correlation and Regression: Finally, it calculates the correlation coefficient between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin regimen.

The findings from this analysis would be specific to the data used, but generally, this code is analyzing how different treatments affect tumor volume over time, how these effects compare across treatments, and whether there’s a relationship between mouse weight and tumor volume.
